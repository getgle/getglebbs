# getglebbs
2channel style textboard software, soon to be replaced with a new rewrite.

pros:
* Posts are stored in an easy to parse JSON file
* Good performance
* Portable as it only requires PHP and no SQL.
* Unique features like homosexual text, fortunes, random numbers and monospace posts
* Constantly backs up the posts file allowing you to revert to an old version easily.

cons:
* I wrote it very quickly and added new features half hazardly. This made the codebase somewhat unwieldy (hence why im rewriting it)
* The json file will wipe itself if multiple people write to it.  (this is fixed in the rewrite)
